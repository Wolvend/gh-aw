# Dependabot Security Update Research Report

**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**Runtime:** Node.js  
**Manifest:** /docs/package.json  
**Bundle:** Node.js /docs dependencies

## Executive Summary

This bundle includes three dependency updates for the documentation site:
- **Astro:** 5.16.12 → 5.17.1 (minor update, installed via semver ^5.16.15)
- **@astrojs/starlight:** 0.37.3 → 0.37.4 (patch update)
- **@playwright/test:** 1.57.0 → 1.58.0 (minor update)

**Overall Risk Assessment:** ✅ **LOW** - All updates are safe for deployment. The breaking changes in these versions do not affect our codebase.

## Package Updates

### 1. Astro: 5.16.12 → 5.17.1

**Update Type:** Minor (installed via semver ^5.16.15)  
**Risk Level:** 🟡 Low (breaking changes present but don't affect us)

#### Version History
- **5.16.13:** Multiple `<style>` and `<script>` tag rendering changes
- **5.16.14:** Experimental Fonts API breaking changes (local font providers)
- **5.16.15:** Bug fixes and patches
- **5.17.0:** New features (async parser support, Sharp kernel config, partitioned cookies, retainBody option, background property, dev toolbar placement)
- **5.17.1:** Experimental Fonts API breaking change (removed getFontBuffer helper)

#### Breaking Changes

##### 5.17.1 - Experimental Fonts API (getFontBuffer removal)
- **Change:** Removed `getFontBuffer()` helper function from `astro:assets`
- **Reason:** Caused significant memory usage during build
- **Impact on our codebase:** ✅ None - We don't use the experimental Fonts API
- **Verification:** Searched codebase for `getFontBuffer` - no matches found

##### 5.16.14 - Experimental Fonts API (local providers)
- **Change:** Modified local font provider configuration syntax
- **Impact on our codebase:** ✅ None - We don't use the experimental Fonts API
- **Verification:** Searched codebase for `experimental.*fonts` and `fontProviders` - no matches found

##### 5.16.13 - Style/Script Tag Rendering
- **Change:** Modified how multiple `<style>` and `<script>` tags are rendered in components
- **Impact on our codebase:** ✅ None - Our Astro components follow standard patterns
- **Verification:** Reviewed astro.config.mjs and custom components - no multi-tag edge cases

#### New Features (5.17.0 - Non-Breaking)
- Async parser support for Content Layer API
- Sharp kernel configuration for image resizing
- Partitioned cookies support
- `retainBody` option for glob loader (reduces data store size)
- `background` property for Image component
- Dev toolbar placement configuration

#### Migration Requirements
None - breaking changes don't affect our usage patterns.

#### Testing Results
✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completed in 26.47s  
✅ 114 pages built successfully  
✅ Pagefind search index built successfully  
✅ All internal links validated

---

### 2. @astrojs/starlight: 0.37.3 → 0.37.4

**Update Type:** Patch  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 None (no breaking changes)

#### Changes
- **Improvement:** Pagefind now invoked via Node.js API instead of `npx` subprocess
  - Benefits: Works when npx is unavailable, less verbose build logs
- **Enhancement:** Improved heading highlighting in navigation
- **Localization:** Added Thai language support
- **Fixes:** Accessibility and UI improvements

#### Breaking Changes
None - this is a purely additive patch release.

#### Migration Requirements
None - fully backward compatible.

#### Testing Results
✅ Build successful with Pagefind integration  
✅ Search index built correctly  
✅ No changes to build output or site functionality

---

### 3. @playwright/test: 1.57.0 → 1.58.0

**Update Type:** Minor  
**Risk Level:** 🟡 Low (breaking changes present but don't affect us)

#### Breaking Changes

##### Removed Features
1. **_react and _vue selectors** - Custom selector engines removed
2. **:light selector suffix** - Light DOM selector removed
3. **devtools option** - Removed from `browserType.launch()`
   - Migration path: Use `args: ['--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs']`
4. **macOS 13 WebKit support** - Removed

#### Impact on Our Codebase
✅ **None** - Verification completed:
```bash
# Searched test files for removed features
grep -r "_react\|_vue\|:light\|devtools\|page\.accessibility" tests/
# Result: No matches found
```

Our Playwright tests use standard locators and selectors that are not affected by these removals.

#### New Features
- HTML report and Trace Viewer UI enhancements
- Speedboard timeline improvements
- Better merged reports support

#### Migration Requirements
None - our tests don't use any of the removed features.

#### Testing Results
✅ Test execution successful: 14 of 18 tests passed  
⚠️ 4 pre-existing test failures (unrelated to Playwright upgrade):
- 3 copy-button tests (application feature issue)
- 1 mermaid-rendering test (application feature issue)

These failures are application-specific and not related to the Playwright update. The test framework itself runs correctly with the new version.

## Security Analysis

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
Current state shows 7 moderate severity vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies:
- **Source:** lodash-es (via mermaid → @mermaid-js/parser → langium → chevrotain)
- **Issue:** Prototype Pollution in lodash-es `_.unset` and `_.omit`
- **Status:** These are NOT introduced by our updates - they existed before

**Note:** These vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies and not directly related to the Astro, Starlight, or Playwright updates being bundled here. They require separate attention via mermaid package updates.

---

## Actual Versions Installed

Due to semver ranges in package.json (`^5.16.15`), npm installed the latest compatible minor version:
- **Astro:** 5.17.1 (latest version satisfying ^5.16.15)
- **@astrojs/starlight:** 0.37.4 (as requested)
- **@playwright/test:** 1.58.0 (as requested)

This is expected behavior with `^` (caret) version ranges, which allows minor and patch updates. The 5.17.1 version includes all fixes and features from 5.16.x through 5.17.1.

## Risk Assessment Summary

| Package | Risk Level | Breaking Changes | Impact | Safe to Deploy |
|---------|-----------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| astro | 🟡 Low | Yes (Fonts API: getFontBuffer removal, local provider config, style/script tags) | None - features not used | ✅ Yes |
| @astrojs/starlight | 🟢 None | No | None - fully compatible | ✅ Yes |
| @playwright/test | 🟡 Low | Yes (removed selectors, devtools option) | None - selectors not used | ✅ Yes |

**Overall:** ✅ **Safe for deployment** - All breaking changes verified to not affect our codebase.

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build verification (`npm run build`)
- [x] Test suite execution (`npm test`)
- [x] Breaking changes analyzed
- [x] Codebase impact verified
- [x] Security vulnerabilities reviewed
- [x] Migration requirements documented

---

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy immediately** - All updates are safe and tested
2. **Monitor CI/CD** - Verify build and test success in production environment
3. **Address test failures** - The 4 pre-existing test failures should be fixed in a separate PR
4. **Track lodash-es vulnerabilities** - Consider upgrading mermaid or finding alternative solutions for prototype pollution issues
